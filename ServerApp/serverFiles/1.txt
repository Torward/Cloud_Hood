17 Progress Bar and Progress Indicator
In this chapter, you learn about the progress indicator and progress bar, the UI controls that visualize progress of any operations in your JavaFX applications.

The ProgressIndicator class and its direct subclass ProgressBar provide the capabilities to indicate that a particular task is processing and to detect how much of this work has been already done. While the ProgressBar class visualizes the progress as a completion bar, the ProgressIndicator class visualizes the progress in the form of a dynamically changing pie chart, as shown in Figure 17-1.

Creating Progress Controls
Use the code fragment in Example 17-1 to insert the progress controls in your JavaFX application.

Example 17-1 Implementing the Progress Bar and Progress Indicator

ProgressBar pb = new ProgressBar(0.6);
ProgressIndicator pi = new ProgressIndicator(0.6);
You can also create the progress controls without parameters by using an empty constructor. In that case, you can assign the value by using the setProgress method.

Sometimes an application cannot determine the full completion time of a task. In that case, progress controls remain in indeterminate mode until the length of the task is determined. Figure 17-2 shows different states of the progress controls depending on their progress variable value.
